# Tower Defense Repository Scope Rule

## Repository Purpose - STRICTLY ENFORCED

This repository is **EXCLUSIVELY** for the basic tower defense demo that serves as Phase 1 of the CyberCrawler vertical slice. 

### What This Repository IS For:
- **Basic tower defense gameplay mechanics**
- **Grid-based map system**  
- **Player tower placement and management**
- **Enemy creep movement and pathfinding**
- **Basic resource management**
- **Simple combat system (towers vs enemies)**
- **Core game loop: build → defend → survive**

### What This Repository IS NOT For:
- ❌ **Stealth gameplay mechanics**
- ❌ **Hub/Safehouse systems**
- ❌ **Character dialogue or story elements**
- ❌ **Complex 3D assets or animations**
- ❌ **Multiple game modes or sections**
- ❌ **Advanced AI systems beyond basic tower defense**
- ❌ **Networking or multiplayer features**
- ❌ **Complete art pipelines or final assets**

## Phase 1 Implementation Guidelines

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- **Single grid map** - Simple, functional layout
- **One type of player tower** - Basic attack functionality
- **One type of enemy creep** - Follows path from A to B
- **Tower placement system** - Click to place, basic validation
- **Enemy spawning system** - Simple wave-based spawning
- **Basic win/lose conditions** - Clear objectives

### Phase 1 Constraints (Must NOT Have)
- **Multiple tower types** - Keep it simple initially
- **Complex enemy varieties** - One basic enemy type only
- **Advanced graphics** - Use colored squares/circles for prototyping
- **Sound/Music integration** - Focus on mechanics first
- **UI polish** - Functional over beautiful
- **Save/Load systems** - Not needed for prototype

## Trello Board Integration

All feature additions must be approved through the [CyberCrawler_VerticalSlice](https://trello.com/b/ZH9jpFH7/cybercrawlerverticalslice) Trello board.

### Development Workflow:
1. **Backlog** - Features must be added here first
2. **To Do** - Ready for implementation
3. **Doing (prototyping)** - Currently being worked on
4. **Done** - Completed and tested

### Expansion Rules:
- **Only add features listed in Trello backlog**
- **No feature creep beyond tower defense scope**
- **All additions must maintain "basic" implementation level**
- **Complex features require breaking down into basic components**

## Implementation Standards

### Code Structure:
- **Modular design** - Separate systems for towers, enemies, grid, etc.
- **Simple architecture** - No over-engineering for basic prototype
- **Clear separation** - Tower logic ≠ Enemy logic ≠ Grid logic
- **Godot best practices** - Use appropriate nodes and scenes

### Asset Requirements:
- **Placeholder art only** - Focus on functionality
- **Consistent style** - Simple geometric shapes or basic sprites
- **No final assets** - This is a prototype, not a finished game
- **Blender workflow** - If 3D models needed, use Blender → 2D pipeline

### Testing Criteria:
- **Can player place towers?** - Basic interaction works
- **Do enemies follow paths?** - Movement system functional
- **Do towers attack enemies?** - Combat system operational
- **Are win/lose conditions clear?** - Game loop complete

## Scope Violation Prevention

### Red Flags - STOP IMMEDIATELY:
- **Adding stealth mechanics** - Wrong repository
- **Creating story elements** - Wrong repository  
- **Building hub systems** - Wrong repository
- **Complex AI beyond basic pathfinding** - Too advanced for Phase 1
- **Multiple game modes** - Scope creep
- **Advanced graphics rendering** - Premature optimization

### Yellow Flags - Review Before Proceeding:
- **Adding second tower type** - Check Trello board first
- **Enemy variety** - Ensure it's in approved backlog
- **UI improvements** - Functional > Beautiful at this stage
- **Performance optimization** - May be premature

## Quality Gates

### Before ANY Implementation:
- [ ] Is this feature on the Trello board?
- [ ] Does this serve the basic tower defense prototype?
- [ ] Am I staying within Phase 1 constraints?
- [ ] Will this help answer "Is the basic TD concept fun?"

### Before ANY Commit:
- [ ] Does the game still focus on tower defense only?
- [ ] Are the core mechanics (place tower, enemy moves, tower shoots) working?
- [ ] Have I avoided adding stealth/hub/story elements?
- [ ] Is this still a "basic" implementation?

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- **Player can place towers on grid**
- **Enemies spawn and follow path**
- **Towers automatically attack enemies in range**
- **Win condition: All enemies defeated**
- **Lose condition: Too many enemies reach end**
- **Core loop is fun and engaging**

### Ready for Phase 2 When:
- **Basic tower defense mechanics proven fun**
- **Code structure supports expansion**
- **All Phase 1 requirements met**
- **Trello board shows Phase 1 tasks complete**

## Rule Enforcement

### Automatic Checks:
- **No stealth-related code** - Keywords: "stealth", "hide", "sneak"
- **No hub-related code** - Keywords: "safehouse", "base", "hub"
- **No story-related code** - Keywords: "dialogue", "cutscene", "narrative"

### Manual Reviews:
- **Weekly scope review** - Are we staying focused?
- **Feature addition review** - Trello board alignment
- **Complexity assessment** - Are we keeping it basic?

**Remember**: This is a prototype to test if the basic tower defense concept is fun. Everything else is scope creep that will delay the vertical slice and violate the phased development approach.

**Focus**: Build the minimum viable tower defense game. Make it fun. Then move to Phase 2.
