Always try to look for tools with the retrieve_tools call first before using the tools directly. You need to look for the proper tool for the job. You need to look by mcp server which I have a few of. We are using a mcp proxy to run the tools.

make sure to use correct project path and project name when using the tools.
example: for godot, the project path is C:/Users/rivie/CursorProjects/CyberCrawler_basic_tower_defense_demo/cybercrawler_basictowerdefense and the project name is cybercrawler_basictowerdefense

GoDot logs: C:/Users/rivie/CursorProjects/CyberCrawler_basic_tower_defense_demo/cybercrawler_basictowerdefense/logs/godot.log

use mcp tools and reading of code first before writing new code to figure out what exists and what doesn't exist. this is to try to prevent hallucinations.

after you figure out the tool you want to use, use call_tool to call the tool.


#IMPORTANT: Read code and use mcp tools first to figure out the code first.

MCP Tools:
- Godot
- Blender
- Trello
- GitHub

you may need to use the documentation of the tool to figure out how to use the tool.
