# CyberCrawler Basic Tower Defense Demo

This repository contains the **Phase 1** prototype for CyberCrawler - a basic tower defense demo that will serve as the foundation for the vertical slice. This is part of CyberCrawler, a 2.5D game that mixes stealth action and tower defense gameplay.

## üéØ Project Scope

This repository is **strictly for the basic tower defense demo** and no other part of the game. Following the phased development approach, this represents the first milestone in the CyberCrawler development roadmap.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Game Engine
- **Godot Engine** - Primary game engine for 2.5D development

### 3D Modeling & Assets
- **Blender** - For creating 3D models and rendering to 2D sprites (isometric workflow)
- **Microsoft Paint** - For concept art and basic 2D editing

### Project Management
- **Trello Board**: [CyberCrawler_VerticalSlice](https://trello.com/b/ZH9jpFH7/cybercrawlerverticalslice)
  - **Lists**: Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí Doing (prototyping) ‚Üí Done
  - Tracks development progress through the 5-phase roadmap

### Development Integration (MCP Tools)
- **Godot MCP** - Integration with Godot Engine for development workflow
- **Blender MCP** - Integration with Blender for 3D-to-2D asset pipeline
- **GitHub MCP** - Version control and repository management
- **Trello MCP** - Project management and task tracking

## üìã Development Phase

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Tower Defense Prototype (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Create the most basic version of the hacking game with:
- Single grid map
- One type of player tower
- One type of enemy creep
- Basic tower placement and enemy movement

**Note**: Following the "Prototype the Fun, Build the Frame Later" philosophy - focusing on core mechanics before visual polish.

## üé® Art Style Guidelines

- **Style**: Stylized 2.5D Isometric
- **Approach**: Hi-Bit Pixel Art or Vector Noir
- **Workflow**: Blender ‚Üí 2D sprite rendering for consistent isometric perspective
- **Constraint**: No photorealistic or complex 3D assets (solo dev limitations)

## üéÆ Core Design Pillars

Every development decision must serve these three pillars:
1. **The Ghost & The Machine** - Player feels powerful yet vulnerable
2. **Asymmetrical Warfare** - Underdog fighting through cunning, not brute force
3. **A Living, Breathing Dystopia** - Technology oppression narrative

## üöÄ Next Steps

This prototype will eventually connect to the stealth sections and hub systems in later phases, forming the complete CyberCrawler vertical slice.
