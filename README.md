# CyberCrawler Basic Tower Defense Demo

This repository contains the **Phase 1** prototype for CyberCrawler - a basic tower defense demo that will serve as the foundation for the vertical slice. This is part of CyberCrawler, a 2.5D game that mixes stealth action and tower defense gameplay.

## üéØ Project Scope

This repository is **strictly for the enhanced tower defense demo** that represents Phase 1B of CyberCrawler development.

### What This Repository IS For:
- **Enhanced tower defense gameplay mechanics** with rival AI opponent
- **Strategic grid-based combat system** (player vs AI hacker)
- **Bidirectional tower combat** (towers fight towers)
- **Program data packet transmission mechanics** (core win condition)
- **Dynamic grid layouts** with strategic positioning
- **Tower health and destruction systems**
- **Rival hacker AI** that places and manages enemy towers
- **Advanced resource management** for strategic depth
- **Freeze Mine mechanic** for tactical play
- **Click-to-destroy enemy entities** for direct player interaction

### What This Repository IS NOT For:
- ‚ùå **Stealth gameplay mechanics** (separate project)
- ‚ùå **Hub/Safehouse systems** (separate project)
- ‚ùå **Character dialogue or story elements**
- ‚ùå **Multiple game modes beyond enhanced tower defense**
- ‚ùå **Networking or multiplayer features**
- ‚ùå **Final art assets** (placeholder art only)

### Current Development Constraints
- **Enhanced tower defense scope only** - No stealth or hub mechanics
- **Strategic depth over visual polish** - Gameplay first, art later  
- **AI opponent focus** - Rival hacker must provide meaningful challenge
- **Modular architecture** - Systems must support future integration
- **Prototype-level implementation** - Functional over polished

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Game Engine
- **Godot Engine** - Primary game engine for 2.5D development

### 3D Modeling & Assets
- **Blender** - For creating 3D models and rendering to 2D sprites (isometric workflow)
- **Microsoft Paint** - For concept art and basic 2D editing

### Project Management
- **Trello Board**: [CyberCrawler_VerticalSlice](https://trello.com/b/ZH9jpFH7/cybercrawlerverticalslice)
  - **Lists**: Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí Doing (prototyping) ‚Üí Done
  - Tracks development progress through the 5-phase roadmap

### Development Integration (MCP Tools)
- **Godot MCP** - Integration with Godot Engine for development workflow
- **Blender MCP** - Integration with Blender for 3D-to-2D asset pipeline
- **GitHub MCP** - Version control and repository management
- **Trello MCP** - Project management and task tracking

## üìã Development Phase

**Current Phase**: Advanced Phase 1 - Enhanced Tower Defense with Rival AI (July 2025)

**Goal**: Evolve the basic tower defense into a dynamic hacker vs hacker conflict with:
- Enhanced grid system with more interesting layouts
- Bidirectional combat (player towers vs enemy towers)
- Rival hacker AI that places defensive towers
- Player program data packet win condition
- Tower health systems and destructible defenses
- Freeze Mine mechanic for tactical play
- Click-to-destroy enemy entities for direct player interaction

**Note**: Core tower defense mechanics are functional. Now enhancing with strategic depth and asymmetrical AI opponent.

## üé® Art Style Guidelines

- **Style**: Stylized 2.5D Isometric
- **Approach**: Hi-Bit Pixel Art or Vector Noir
- **Workflow**: Blender ‚Üí 2D sprite rendering for consistent isometric perspective
- **Constraint**: No photorealistic or complex 3D assets (solo dev limitations)

## üéÆ Core Design Pillars

Every development decision must serve these three pillars:
1. **The Ghost & The Machine** - Player feels powerful yet vulnerable
2. **Asymmetrical Warfare** - Underdog fighting through cunning, not brute force
3. **A Living, Breathing Dystopia** - Technology oppression narrative

## üìà Project Evolution

### Phase 1A: Basic Tower Defense ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Single grid map with simple path
- [x] Basic player towers that shoot at enemies  
- [x] Enemy waves that move along path
- [x] Currency system and tower purchasing
- [x] Win/lose conditions (10 waves survival)
- [x] Victory screen implementation

### Phase 1B: Enhanced Strategic Tower Defense üöß IN PROGRESS
**Current Focus**: Evolving from simple "survive waves" to **strategic hacker duel**

**Core New Mechanics (All Implemented):**
- **Rival Hacker AI** - AI opponent places enemy towers to counter player strategies (now alert-driven and adaptive)
- **Bidirectional Combat** - Towers fight towers (not just towers vs creeps)
- **Program Data Packet** - Player win condition requires getting data through enemy defenses (fully implemented)
- **Enhanced Grid** - More complex layouts enabling strategic depth (multiple path types implemented)
- **Tower Health Systems** - Destructible towers create dynamic battlefield (health bars, destruction, and rebuilding)
- **Freeze Mine Mechanic** - Players can place freeze mines to temporarily disable enemy towers
- **Click-to-Destroy Enemy Entities** - Players can directly click on enemies, enemy towers, and rival hackers to deal damage

**Why This Evolution:**
The basic tower defense worked but lacked strategic depth. The enhanced version creates a **chess-like tactical experience** where player and AI opponent compete for grid control, making each placement decision critical.

### Technical Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Core tower defense loop functional
- ‚úÖ Currency and purchasing systems working
- ‚úÖ Wave management and victory conditions fixed
- ‚úÖ Enhanced grid layouts (multiple path types) implemented
- ‚úÖ Rival hacker AI system (alert-driven, adaptive) implemented
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional combat system implemented
- ‚úÖ Program Data Packet system implemented
- ‚úÖ Freeze Mine mechanic implemented
- ‚úÖ Click-to-destroy enemy entities implemented
- ‚úÖ Tower health systems implemented
- üöß Continuous balancing, tuning, and bugfixing
- üöß Further AI sophistication and strategic depth

## üöÄ Current Development Focus (From Trello Board)

### Currently in Development
1. **Continuous balancing and bugfixing** - Ongoing gameplay tuning to ensure fun and engaging mechanics
2. **Further AI sophistication and strategic depth**
3. **Polish and UI/UX improvements**

### Immediate Priorities (To Do)
- [x] Enhanced Grid System - Complete
- [x] Player Program Data Packet - Complete
- [x] Rival Hacker AI System - Complete
- [x] Bidirectional Combat - Complete
- [x] Tower Health Systems - Complete
- [x] Freeze Mine Mechanic - Complete
- [x] Click-to-Destroy Enemy Entities - Complete
- [ ] Continuous Balancing and Tuning
- [ ] Further AI sophistication and strategic depth
- [ ] Polish and bugfixing

### Enhanced Tower Defense Vision
Moving beyond simple "waves of enemies" to a **strategic hacker duel** where:
- Player and AI hacker both place towers on the same grid
- Player must send a program data packet through enemy defenses
- Enemy AI actively counters player strategies (alert-driven, adaptive)
- Dynamic, chess-like gameplay emerges from tower placement decisions
- Players can use freeze mines and direct clicks for tactical advantage

### Development Path
This enhanced tower defense will serve as the foundation for the full CyberCrawler experience, eventually connecting to stealth infiltration and hub progression systems in later phases.

## üßä Freeze Mine Mechanic

- Players can place freeze mines on the grid using a dedicated UI button.
- Freeze mines temporarily disable ("freeze") enemy towers within a radius when triggered.
- Mines have a cost, limited uses, and visual feedback for activation and depletion.
- Integrated with the currency system and grid validation.
- Adds a new layer of tactical play and counterplay against the rival AI.

## üñ±Ô∏è Click-to-Destroy Enemy Entities

- Players can toggle between "build" and "attack" modes using a UI button.
- In attack mode, clicking on enemies, enemy towers, or rival hackers deals direct damage.
- Each entity type has its own click radius, damage, and feedback.
- Adds a new interactive layer to the core gameplay loop.
