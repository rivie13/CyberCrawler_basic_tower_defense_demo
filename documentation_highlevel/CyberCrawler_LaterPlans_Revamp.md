This is a list of specific features that I want to add to the game later on.

the player should have to work between multiple terminals in the 2.5d world to play the tower defense game.

for instance one terminal is the main terminal, and that is where the program data packets are stored and released, it is the hardest terminal to get to.

another terminal is a terminal to place towers, another is for the mines, and other terminals for other things yet to be determined.

if the player sets the alarm off while sneaking in the 2.5d world, the player will alert the rival hacker in the tower defense game.

the 2.5d stealth action part of the game should be more connected to the tower defense part of the game.

if the player sets off the rival hacker in the tower defense game, the alert will also set off the alarm in the 2.5d world, so guards and other enemies will be alerted and try to look for the player.

the player is frantically moving between terminals to play the tower defense game, and the rival hacker is trying to stop the player (through the tower defense game and alerting the guards in the 2.5d world) before they can release their program data packet into the enemy network through the main terminal.

this is how you make a stealth action tower defense game.


the reason why enemies show up in tower defense game while the rival hacker is not alerted is because they have the good corpo security system, so they have at least a little bit of security against the player and their hacking....

the rival hacker is strictly in the tower defense game, and the player is in the 2.5d world but jacks into the tower defense game to play it.... they do it through a terminal in the 2.5d world but there are multiple terminals in the 2.5d world with one main terminal that is the hardest to get to.

the program data packet is the main goal of the game, and the player is trying to release it into the enemy network through the main terminal. it is the win condition. your ultimate goal is to release the program data packet into the enemy network through the main terminal. 

a separate terminal would be for upgrades for existing items the player has placed in the tower defense game.
