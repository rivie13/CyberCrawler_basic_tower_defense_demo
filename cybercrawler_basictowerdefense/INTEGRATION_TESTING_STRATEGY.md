# Integration Testing Strategy for CyberCrawler Tower Defense

## Overview

This document outlines our systematic approach to creating proper integration tests that verify how different game systems work together in the CyberCrawler tower defense demo. Integration tests differ from unit tests by using real managers and testing cross-system interactions rather than isolated components with mocks.

## Integration Testing Principles

### Core Differences: Integration vs Unit Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Use mocks, test isolated components, focus on single class behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Use real managers, test system interactions, verify end-to-end workflows

### Our Testing Philosophy
Based on project memory: [[memory:4548427]]
- **Unit tests**: Should use mocks and only test simple, easily-isolated code
- **Integration tests**: Should use real managers (not mocks) to test more complicated or signal-related cases
- **System tests**: Should not use mocks and test the entire system

## 4-Step Integration Testing Process

### Step 1: Look at Code to be Tested
**Purpose**: Understand the system components and their interactions
**Actions**:
- Identify the main classes/managers involved in the system
- Map dependencies between systems
- Understand the data flow and communication patterns
- Identify key integration points and workflows

**Tools to Use**:
- `codebase_search` for understanding system architecture
- `read_file` for examining specific implementation details
- `grep_search` for finding cross-system method calls and dependencies

### Step 2: Examine Documentation
**Purpose**: Understand GUT framework capabilities and testing patterns
**Key Documentation Points**:
- All test scripts must extend `GutTest`
- Test files must begin with `test_` prefix
- Use `before_each()`, `after_each()`, `before_all()`, `after_all()` for setup/teardown
- Integration tests go in `res://test/integration/`
- Use `add_child_autofree()` for automatic cleanup

**GUT Framework Features**:
- Rich assertion library (`assert_eq`, `assert_true`, `assert_not_null`, etc.)
- Automatic test discovery based on method names starting with "test"
- Setup/teardown lifecycle methods
- Inner classes for test grouping

### Step 3: Plan the Test
**Purpose**: Design comprehensive test scenarios before implementation
**Planning Checklist**:
- [ ] Identify all systems involved in the integration
- [ ] Map out the complete workflow to be tested
- [ ] Define initial state setup requirements
- [ ] Identify expected outcomes and assertions
- [ ] Plan error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Consider cleanup requirements

**Test Scenario Types**:
1. **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user action sequences
2. **Cross-System Communication**: Verify system-to-system interactions
3. **State Synchronization**: Ensure systems maintain consistent state
4. **Error Propagation**: Verify error handling across systems
5. **Complex Multi-System Scenarios**: Advanced gameplay situations

### Step 4: Make Tests After Approval
**Purpose**: Implement comprehensive integration tests following approved plan
**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Use real manager instances (no mocks)
- Initialize systems with proper dependencies
- Test complete workflows from start to finish
- Verify state changes across multiple systems
- Include comprehensive error handling scenarios

## Integration Test Quality Standards

### ‚úÖ **Required Characteristics**
- **Use Real Managers**: All manager instances must be real, not mocked
- **Test System Boundaries**: Verify how systems communicate across boundaries
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Test complete user scenarios from start to finish
- **State Verification**: Confirm state changes propagate correctly across systems
- **Dependency Injection**: Test that systems work together through real dependencies

### ‚úÖ **Test Structure Template**
```gdscript
extends GutTest

# Integration tests for [System] interactions with other game systems
# These tests verify [specific integration aspect]

var system_manager: SystemManager
var dependency_manager_1: DependencyManager1
var dependency_manager_2: DependencyManager2

func before_each():
    # Create real manager instances
    system_manager = SystemManager.new()
    dependency_manager_1 = DependencyManager1.new()
    dependency_manager_2 = DependencyManager2.new()
    
    # Add to scene tree for proper lifecycle
    add_child_autofree(system_manager)
    add_child_autofree(dependency_manager_1)
    add_child_autofree(dependency_manager_2)
    
    # Initialize with real dependencies
    system_manager.initialize(dependency_manager_1, dependency_manager_2)

func test_complete_workflow_integration():
    # Integration test: [Description of complete workflow]
    # This tests: [specific integration points]
    
    # Setup initial state
    # Perform action that spans multiple systems
    # Verify state changes across all affected systems
    # Test edge cases and error conditions
```
