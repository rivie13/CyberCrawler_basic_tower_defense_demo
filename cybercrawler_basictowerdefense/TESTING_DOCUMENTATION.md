# CyberCrawler Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the testing system implemented for the CyberCrawler enhanced tower defense project. The testing framework uses GUT (Godot Unit Test) with advanced code coverage validation and automated CI/CD integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED SYSTEMS

#### 1. Test Framework Setup
- **GUT Framework**: Fully installed and configured
- **Coverage System**: Advanced code coverage with pre/post-run hooks
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- **Test Structure**: Organized unit, integration, and system test directories

#### 2. Test Coverage (As of Latest Run)
- **Total Tests**: 382 tests across 20 test scripts
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% (382/382 passing)
- **Code Coverage**: 84.6% for files with tests (1400/1655 lines)
- **Files with Tests**: 18 out of 22 script files (81.8% coverage)

#### 3. Coverage Requirements Met
- **Per-File Coverage**: All tested files meet 50% OR 100 lines minimum (whichever is LESS)
- **Total Coverage**: 75% requirement waived (only 81.8% of files have tests, need 90%)
- **Validation**: Automated coverage validation prevents merging insufficiently tested code

## How to Run Tests

### Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\rivie\CursorProjects\CyberCrawler_basic_tower_defense_demo\cybercrawler_basictowerdefense"

# Run all unit tests
& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --headless --script addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gtest=tests/unit/ -gexit

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --headless --script addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gexit
```

### Godot Editor
1. Open project in Godot Editor
2. Install GUT plugin from AssetLib if not already installed
3. Enable GUT plugin in Project Settings > Plugins
4. Use GUT panel at bottom of editor
5. Set test directories: `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/system`
6. Click "Run All" or run specific tests

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automatic**: Tests run on every push/PR via GitHub Actions
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually in GitHub repository
- **Results**: Available in GitHub Actions tab and as artifacts

## Code Coverage System

### Coverage Requirements
- **Per-File Coverage**: 50% of file OR 100 lines minimum, whichever is LESS
- **Total Coverage**: 75% required only when 90% of code has tests
- **Validation**: Automated validation prevents merging insufficiently tested code

### Coverage Validation Process
1. **Pre-Run Hook**: Initializes coverage instrumentation
2. **Test Execution**: Collects coverage data during test runs
3. **Post-Run Hook**: Validates coverage requirements and fails tests if insufficient

## Test Implementation Details

### Test Patterns Used
- **before_each()**: Fresh setup for each test
- **add_child_autofree()**: Automatic cleanup of test objects
- **watch_signals()**: Signal emission testing
- **Mock Objects**: Isolated testing of individual components
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Key Test Features
- **Isolation**: Each test runs independently
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both success and failure paths
- **Real Integration**: Tests actual system interactions
- **Performance**: Fast execution (0.696s for 382 tests)
- **Reliability**: 100% pass rate with proper error handling

### Test Quality Metrics
- **Test Count**: 382 tests across 20 scripts
- **Assert Count**: 1090 assertions
- **Execution Time**: 0.696 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 100% (382/382 passing)
- **Coverage**: 84.6% for tested files

### Testing Strategy VERY IMPORTANT MUST FOLLOW THIS PLAN
- **Read the Files**: Make sure to read the file to be tested and dependencies it has to understand what you need to do
- **Read the Docs**: Make sure to read the GUT documentation to understand any limitations there may be to what we need to test
- **Create a plan**: Create a plan of how to write the tests properly
- **Write the Tests**: Actually write the tests, but only after you have done the previous steps!!!

- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run on every commit automatically

### 🐛 Bug Prevention
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 84.6% coverage of tested files
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-system interaction validation

### 📚 Living Documentation
- **Behavior Specification**: Tests document expected behavior

### 🔄 Development Workflow
- **Fast Feedback**: 0.696s execution time for 382 tests
- **Confidence**: 100% pass rate enables safe refactoring
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation prevents quality regression

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"GutTest not found"**: Install GUT plugin from AssetLib
2. **Tests not discovered**: Check file naming (must start with `test_`)
3. **Coverage validation fails**: Write more tests for failing files
4. **CI/CD failures**: Check Godot version compatibility

### Performance Issues
- **Slow test execution**: Tests run in 0.696s for 382 tests
- **Memory leaks**: 68 orphans detected (mostly expected GUT objects)
- **Resource cleanup**: Automatic cleanup via add_child_autofree()

### Coverage Issues
- **Insufficient coverage**: Add tests for files below 50% coverage
- **Missing files**: Add tests for files without test coverage
- **Validation failures**: Coverage requirements prevent merging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **System Tests**: End-to-end game scenario testing
2. **More Integration Tests!!!**: Need to make sure mechanics don't break so we need more integration tests!!!
3. **Performance Tests**: Frame rate and memory benchmarking
4. **Visual Tests**: Screenshot comparison testing
5. **Stress Tests**: High-load scenario validation

### Coverage Goals
1. **100% Test Coverage**: Add tests for remaining 4 files
2. **90% File Coverage**: Achieve 90% of files having tests
3. **75% Total Coverage**: Enable total coverage requirement
4. **Integration Coverage**: Expand cross-system testing

### Quality Improvements
1. **Test Organization**: Better categorization and naming
2. **Mock System**: Enhanced mocking for complex dependencies
3. **Test Data**: Centralized test data management
4. **Documentation**: Enhanced test documentation and examples
