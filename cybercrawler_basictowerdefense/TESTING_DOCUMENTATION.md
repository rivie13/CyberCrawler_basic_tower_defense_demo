## How to Run Tests

### Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\rivie\CursorProjects\CyberCrawler_basic_tower_defense_demo\cybercrawler_basictowerdefense"


# Run all tests (unit + integration)
& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --headless --script addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gexit
```

### Godot Editor
1. Open project in Godot Editor
2. Install GUT plugin from AssetLib if not already installed
3. Enable GUT plugin in Project Settings > Plugins
4. Use GUT panel at bottom of editor
5. Set test directories: `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/system`
6. Click "Run All" or run specific tests

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automatic**: Tests run on every push/PR via GitHub Actions
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually in GitHub repository
- **Results**: Available in GitHub Actions tab and as artifacts

## Code Coverage System

### Dual Coverage Metrics
The testing system now tracks **two separate coverage percentages** to provide more accurate metrics:

#### 1. **All Files Coverage** (43.8%)
- **What it measures**: Percentage of ALL script files that have tests
- **Includes**: Interfaces, special cases, and files with alternative testing approaches
- **Purpose**: Overall project test coverage overview

#### 2. **Required Files Coverage** (66.7%)
- **What it measures**: Percentage of files that actually need tests
- **Excludes**: 
  - Interface files (tested through implementations)
  - Files split into multiple smaller test files (like MainController.gd)
  - Files using mocks for dependency injection testing
- **Purpose**: **Primary metric for coverage requirements**

### Coverage Requirements
- **Per-File Coverage**: If it has a test, then 50% of file OR 100 lines minimum, whichever is LESS
- **Total Coverage**: 75% across ALL files required when 90% of files that need tests have tests
- **Test Coverage Metrics**: 
  - **All Files**: Percentage of all script files that have tests
  - **Required Files**: Percentage of files that actually need tests (excludes interfaces, special cases)
- **Validation**: Automated validation prevents merging insufficiently tested code

### Files Excluded from Test Requirements
The following files are excluded from test requirements because they use alternative testing approaches:

- **Interface Files**: `TowerManagerInterface.gd`, `Clickable.gd`, `CurrencyManagerInterface.gd`, etc.
  - **Reason**: Tested through their implementations, not directly
- **MainController.gd**: 
  - **Reason**: Split into multiple smaller test files for better organization
- **Files with Mocks**: 
  - **Reason**: Use dependency injection with mock objects for testing

### Coverage Validation Process
1. **Pre-Run Hook**: Initializes coverage instrumentation
2. **Test Execution**: Collects coverage data during test runs
3. **Post-Run Hook**: Validates coverage requirements and fails tests if insufficient


## Test Implementation Details

### Test Patterns Used
- **before_each()**: Fresh setup for each test
- **add_child_autofree()**: Automatic cleanup of test objects
- **watch_signals()**: Signal emission testing
- **Mock Objects**: Isolated testing of individual components
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **State-Based Testing**: Testing observable effects rather than implementation details

### Critical Lessons Learned

#### 1. Mock Object Initialization Requirements
**Issue**: Mock objects may require explicit initialization before use, even if the real objects don't.

**Problem Example**: 
```gdscript
# This will fail - mock not initialized
mock_tower_manager.place_tower(grid_pos, tower_type)
assert_eq(mock_tower_manager.get_towers().size(), 1)  # Returns 0!
```

**Solution**: Always initialize mock objects before use:
```gdscript
# Correct approach
mock_tower_manager.initialize(mock_grid_manager, mock_currency_manager, mock_wave_manager)
mock_tower_manager.place_tower(grid_pos, tower_type)
assert_eq(mock_tower_manager.get_towers().size(), 1)  # Now works correctly
```

**Rule**: **Always check if mock objects need initialization and call their initialize() method before use.**

#### 2. Interface Compliance in Dependency Injection
**Issue**: Direct property access violates dependency injection principles and breaks when using mock objects.

**Problem Example**:
```gdscript
# This breaks with mock objects that don't have the property
wave_manager.enemy_path.clear()
wave_manager.enemy_path.append(new_position)
```

**Solution**: Always use interface methods instead of direct property access:
```gdscript
# Correct approach - uses interface method
var enemy_path = wave_manager.get_enemy_path()
enemy_path.clear()
enemy_path.append(new_position)
```

**Rule**: **Never access properties directly on injected dependencies. Always use interface methods.**

#### 3. Mock Object State Verification
**Issue**: Mock objects may not track state correctly if not properly initialized or if their methods don't update internal state.

**Debugging Approach**:
```gdscript
# Add debug output to understand mock behavior
print("DEBUG: Mock tower manager has ", mock_tower_manager.get_towers().size(), " towers")
print("DEBUG: Mock tower manager get_tower_count(): ", mock_tower_manager.get_tower_count())
```

**Rule**: **When tests fail unexpectedly with mock objects, add debug output to verify mock state and behavior.**

#### 4. Test Setup Completeness
**Issue**: Tests may fail because not all dependencies are properly set up.

**Checklist for Test Setup**:
- [ ] All mock objects are initialized
- [ ] All dependencies are injected correctly
- [ ] Test data is properly seeded
- [ ] Mock objects track state correctly
- [ ] Interface methods are used instead of direct property access

**Rule**: **Always verify that mock objects are in the expected state before running assertions.**

### Key Test Features
- **Isolation**: Each test runs independently
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both success and failure paths
- **Real Integration**: Tests actual system interactions
- **Performance**: Fast execution (1.079s for 377 tests)
- **Reliability**: 100% pass rate with proper error handling

### Test Quality Metrics

## Testing Strategy VERY IMPORTANT MUST FOLLOW THIS PLAN
- **Read the Files**: Make sure to read the file to be tested and dependencies it has to understand what you need to do
- **Read the Docs**: Make sure to read the GUT documentation to understand any limitations there may be to what we need to test
- **Create a plan**: Create a plan of how to write the tests properly
- **Write the Tests**: Actually write the tests, but only after you have done the previous steps!!!
  - AND ONLY DO ONE AT A TIME TEST IT AFTER TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS BEFORE JUST MOVING ON TO DO ANOTHER TEST!!!

## IMPORTANT: Coverage and Test Execution Guidance

### GUT Coverage and Test Validation: Editor and Command Line

**✅ UPDATE: Code coverage DOES work reliably in both the Godot editor and command line.**

Our coverage system with pre/post-run hooks works correctly in both environments:

BUTTTTT you may need to delete the .godot folder in the project directory (in the godot part of the directory in file explorer) and launch the project again to get the coverage to work properly. somehow that worked for me....

### Running Tests in the Godot Editor
- **Coverage tracking works** - The GUT panel shows accurate coverage results
- **Use for development** - Quick feedback during test development and debugging
- **Coverage validation works** - Pre/post-run hooks enforce coverage requirements
- **Visual interface** - Easy to run individual tests or test groups

### Running Tests from Command Line
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\rivie\CursorProjects\CyberCrawler_basic_tower_defense_demo\cybercrawler_basictowerdefense";
& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --headless --script addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gtest=tests/unit/ -gexit
```

- **Use for CI/CD** - Automated testing and coverage validation
- **Batch execution** - Run all tests without manual intervention
- **Consistent environment** - Matches production CI environment

---

## Running Individual Tests in the Godot Editor (GUT)

- To run individual tests, you must use the official Godot editor (not Cursor or VSCode unless using the GUT extension).
- Open the GUT panel at the bottom of the Godot editor.
- Configure your test directories in the GUT panel settings (e.g., `res://tests/unit`, `res://tests/integration`).
- To run a single test script: open the script in the editor and click the button with the script's name in the GUT panel.
- To run a single test function: place your cursor inside the function and click the button with the function's name in the GUT panel.
- **Reference:** [GUT Quick Start](https://gut.readthedocs.io/en/v9.4.0/Quick-Start.html)

### ⚠️ Known Limitation: Custom Signal Tests in Headless Mode

- When running tests in headless mode (command line, CI, or GUT's headless runner), custom Godot signals (such as `game_over_triggered` and `game_won_triggered` in `GameManager`) may not be reliably delivered or received, even when using real node classes and all best practices (scene tree, yielding, call_deferred, etc.).
- This is a known limitation/bug in Godot 4.x and GUT. See [GUT documentation](https://gut.readthedocs.io/en/v9.4.0/Quick-Start.html) and [GUT GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/issues) for more details.
- **Resolution**: Signal tests have been replaced with state-based tests that verify observable effects rather than signal emission. This provides better coverage and reliability.

## Test Directory Structure (Updated)

Tests are now organized into subdirectories by system/feature for clarity and maintainability. This applies to both unit and integration tests.

```
cybercrawler_basictowerdefense/
  tests/
    unit/
      Enemy/
        test_enemy.gd
      Tower/
        test_tower.gd
        test_tower_manager.gd
        ...
      ...
    integration/
      Combat/
        test_combat_system_integration.gd
      Currency/
        test_currency_flow.gd
      ...
```

- **All test discovery and coverage validation scripts have been updated to support this structure.**
- You can add new test files in the appropriate subdirectory for the system or feature being tested.

---

## CI and Coverage Validation

- The CI workflow runs all tests and coverage validation from the command line, ensuring consistent results and enforcing coverage requirements.
- If coverage or tests fail, CI will fail the build.
- Coverage results are reliable in both the Godot editor and command line environments.

---

## Troubleshooting: Coverage Issues

- If you see coverage issues, check that:
  - You are running tests with the proper GUT setup (pre/post-run hooks enabled).
  - No scripts are being loaded before the pre-run hook (avoid autoloads that reference scripts under test).
  - The test directory structure matches the organization described above.

---

## Summary of Recent Refactoring

- **Tests are now organized into subdirectories by system/feature.**
- **Coverage hooks and validation scripts have been updated to support recursive test discovery.**
- **CI is configured to use the command line for all test and coverage validation.**
- **Coverage works reliably in both Godot editor and command line environments.**
- **Signal tests have been replaced with state-based tests for better reliability.**
